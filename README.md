# Weather and Location Site (weatherWise Nomads)

## Description

 An innovative weather website, where exploring the world’s weather is just a click away! Our interactive world map allows you to seamlessly navigate through different locations, providing you with up-to-date weather information and a unique twist – facts from Wikipedia for a deeper dive into the local culture and geography.

## Installation

This is a webpage, so no installation is required

## Usage

Navigate through the webpage as usual. Upon clicking any location on the embedded map, a modal will appear with the current weather for that location. Upon closing the modal, information about the area (if it has a wiki page!) or its nearest wikipedia page will be displayed below. If you like what you read, you can add the location to your favourites. Favourites cards can be clicked to reopen the wiki information in a modal. Favourites can be cleared at anytime.
